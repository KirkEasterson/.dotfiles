# # Color configuration has the following api
# colors:
#     entity:
#         fg: # foreground (Can be Hex value or a color name)
#         bg: # background (Can be Hex value or a color name)
#         bold: # true/false (boolean)
#         italic: # true/false (boolean)

# for e.g
colors:
    artist:
        fg: "#ff0000"
        bg: black # Background will be ignored in most cases. (Terminals default background color is used)
        bold: false
        italic: true

# For the default colors used for the "entities" please see:
# https://github.com/aditya-K2/gspt/blob/master/extras/CONFIG.md
# Available color names (i.e. pink, green, etc.) can be seen here:
# https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/blob/main/color.go#L845

# # Key mappings has the following API
# mappings:
#     view:
#         mode: # normal/visual
#             function: key_mapping

# # for e.g
# mappings:
#     recently_played_view:
#         normal:
#             play_entry: "ctrl-p"
#         visual:
#             add_to_playlist: "a"

# "global" mappings are special mappings that are not view specific
# ( "toggle_playback", "next", "previous", etc.)
# These mappings can be changed for different views.
# for e.g

mappings:
    global:
        normal:
            previous: "N"
    recently_played_view:
        normal:
            previous: "P"

# As you can assume, here "N" will be globally mapped to the "previous" function,
# and then "P" will too be mapped to "previous" in the recently_played_view (keep
# in mind that "N" will still be mapped to the "previous" function i.e "N" and
# "P" will both be mapped to the same function in recently_played_view)

# Visual Mode is similar to vim. Only some views support it.
# (viz. playlist_view, recently_played_view, liked_songs_view, album_view)

# For the default mappings for each view please see:
# https://github.com/aditya-K2/gspt/blob/master/extras/CONFIG.md
